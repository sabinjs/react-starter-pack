#### Note: 
- All the test files should be inside ```tests``` folder

- If you don't want to use ```$ ./node_modules/.bin/karma``` then install karma as global

### Build for production
- ```$ npm run build:prod```
- The production build will be created at ```dist/``` folder

### Using proxy for api (when api is in different URL to prevent CORS)
- Put your api starting with "/api/"
- The webpack server will redirect to http://localhost:3030/api/ instead of http://localhost:4040/api/
- `To change the port and namespace look at tools/server.js`

- Coverage generated by ```$ npm test``` is stored inside ```coverage``` folder
- Coverage generated by ```$ ./node_modules/.bin/karma``` is stored inside ```karma-coverage``` folder

### Todo
- Add React Redux
